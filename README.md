# multi_360_servo-thing #

a simple thing for the "[Modular-Things](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-things)" project that allows you to control up to 8 360Â° (continuous rotation) RC servos, 4 analog inputs and the built-in RGB LED

> Nota bene: in contrast to the "things" provided by the "Modular Things" project itself, this one has been developed for a [Pimoroni Tiny2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2040) board (simply because I just had one on my desk). Since it uses the built-in RGB LEDs of that board, you may have to adjust the LED output commands in the Arduino "Firmware" shown below in order to make a thing for a different board.
